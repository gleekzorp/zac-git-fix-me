# Bugs!!!!

> Please work through this project and help me fix all the nasty bugs.

> Please be kind to the next person and update the readme files.  Such as how to get the python server up and running, how to get the database setup, what routes are available, how to get the react client started, ect.

> After you have fixed all the bugs and updated the readme files.  Please try and make it your own.  There is currently no styles, some of the api routes are not even being used and the clients folder has some horrible file organization.
