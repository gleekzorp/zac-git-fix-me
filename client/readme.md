To start client side server:

1. In your terminal, navigate to the correct client directory with "cd client" command.

2. Enter "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies (node_modules) to enter the server-capable environment.

3. Run the command "npm start", provided there is no error, then CTRL/CMD + 'click' to enter the server address listed in the terminal.
